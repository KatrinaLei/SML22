GR5241 Data Analysis Project

In the first part of the project, I'm using MNIST dataset to train the single layer neural network with 100 hidden units, 0.1 learning rate and 0 momentum.

And then training the CNN with 0.1 learning rate and 0 momentum. And I found that the test errors in CNN are usually smaller than that in single layer neural network.


Then I trained the 2 layer CNN with introduction of dropout and batch normalization.

The second part of the project, I use the dataset of train.txt, test.txt, val.txt.

Using deep learning architecture with respect to train.txt, val.txt and test.txt.

The detailed code and explainations are in the .ipynb file and the pdf report.
